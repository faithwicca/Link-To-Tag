# Link-To-Tag
This script changes a link to tag in all notes of your Obsidian vault
## What it does
"[[tag]]" or "[[tag|display]]" is changed to just "tag" or just "display" in text. In the end of your note it leaves "#tag".

## Why
It might be useful if  you have too much notes connected to a certain link(because link is too wide as a topic), your graph looks like a flower or too messy.
